you select the share for which
- html - for checkbox
- how to trigger the graph (jquery)
  bind a click handler to the check box on the screen using a class selector - done

  find the share symbol - done
  then post ajax request to the server for the stock details - to get the server to ask yahoo for the data that is required for the graph - in order to do this we need a route
- routes file
  the server gets a message - get a url with the stock symbol and a action that indicates that you want yahoo stuff
  <contoller name>#<actionname> and parameter - which is either params (if get) or body of data (if post)

- controller
  controller has action def (which is from the url).
  - this is most likely going to be a get - take symbol from params
  - this will make call to yahoo. yahoo returns json object containing the graph data
  - this is returned to the browser/view sending json data
- back to jquery -
  .done deals with async reponse
  - call morris to diplay graph using data from callback
  - formatting html

- display the graph - html - we need selector where display graph
